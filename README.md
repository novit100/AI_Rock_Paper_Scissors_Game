A rock paper scissors game in python using opencv and mediapipe
Rock-Paper-Scissors Game video 
A playful game of rock✊ paper✋ scissors✂️ 
The project is written in Python language and with the usage of the libraries opencv (cv2) and mediapipe which represented the means of using computer vision.

I used a model to identify hands according to defined milestones (AKA landmarks) and taught the model to distinguish between hand movements.

Game moves that were taken into account in the project:
• Start a game by raising a full hand
• Presentation of a legal hand gesture
• Change movement several times during 5 seconds
• Play consecutive games
• Finish the game by raising two full hands
• User feedback along the way

This is how the game looks:
